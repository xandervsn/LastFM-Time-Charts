## A few notes:
###### This application is still in the early stages of development. To use, enter LastFM username (e.g. p4pillio), check the 'artist' box, and press button labeled 'tewst.' To enable access to the Deezer API, check the 'deezer' box. This will drastically improve program accuracy, but also duration. To end this program early (as it may take a long time to finish), press the 'Stop' button. To load table, simply press the 'Rank' column. The table is a little bit janky still, but the scripting itself should work.
